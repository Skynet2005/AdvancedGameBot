## Introduction

The Adaptive Game Bot is an advanced AI-powered system designed to play and learn from various video games. It utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, computer vision, and reinforcement learning to analyze game states, make decisions, and adapt to new scenarios in real-time.

Key features include:

- Deep Q-Network (DQN) for reinforcement learning
- Computer vision capabilities for game state analysis
- Meta-learning for quick adaptation to new games
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for leveraging game knowledge
- User interface for bot control and performance monitoring

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- `/api`: Contains API-related modules for OpenAI and Ollama integration
- `/model`: Includes core ML models such as DQN, meta-learner, and vision models
- `/ui`: Houses the user interface components
- `/utils`: Contains utility functions and helper classes
- `/vision`: Implements computer vision algorithms for game state analysis

## Key Components

1. **Game Logic (`game_logic.py`)**: Central component that integrates various ML models and manages the game state.

2. **Deep Q-Network (`dq_network.py`)**: Implements the DQN model for reinforcement learning.

3. **Meta Learner (`meta_learner.py`)**: Enables quick adaptation to new game scenarios.

4. **Vision Model (`vision_model.py`)**: Handles image processing and feature extraction from game states.

5. **User Interface (`main_window.py`, `control_panel.py`, `game_view.py`)**: Provides a graphical interface for controlling the bot and visualizing its performance.

6. **RAG Utils (`rag_utils.py`)**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation for leveraging game knowledge.

7. **Object Detection (`object_detection.py`)**: Detects and localizes objects in game scenes.

8. **Semantic Segmentation (`semantic_segmentation.py`)**: Performs pixel-wise classification of game scenes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adaptive-game-bot.git
cd adaptive-game-bot
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the OpenAI API key:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Start the main application:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Use the control panel to:

   - Start/stop the bot
   - Toggle manual mode
   - Adjust the exploration rate (epsilon)
   - Enable/disable object detection and segmentation visualization

3. The game view will display the current game state with optional overlays for object detection and segmentation.

4. Monitor the bot's performance using the performance metrics panel.

## Technical Details

### Reinforcement Learning

The bot uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay and target network for stable learning. The DQN is implemented in `dq_network.py` and includes:

- Prioritized experience replay
- Double DQN architecture
- Dueling network architecture

### Computer Vision

The vision pipeline (`vision_model.py`) includes:

- Feature extraction using a pre-trained ResNet-50
- Object detection using Faster R-CNN
- Semantic segmentation
- Optical flow computation for motion analysis

### Meta-Learning

The meta-learner (`meta_learner.py`) implements Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to quickly adapt to new game scenarios.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation

The RAG system (`rag_utils.py`) uses FAISS for efficient similarity search and retrieves relevant game knowledge to augment the bot's decision-making process.
